This is a Nest.js Playground project which contains a 
CRUD API that connects to a PostgresSQL Database deployed on Supabase.

The main focus of this project was to see how TypeORM works as I 
compare its functionality to Prisma. 

This project is my playground for Nest.js as I have realized it is 
an amazing framework for building server side applications.

Definitely better than plain express.js

So far I think I will stick to Prisma for now
